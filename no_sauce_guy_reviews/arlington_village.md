### Arlington Village Restaurant Reviews

[Supreme Hot Pot (google maps link)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vbGLrjoPjdkPMnpD8)
<br>
I ate: A5 Wagyu. Generic Buffet meats. Golden Bread. Fried Rice. Honestly I thought the majority of the meats were ~okay. I liked the golden bread a lot. I got the house special bone marrow broth and found the broth to only be a little more flavorful than I could manage at home.
<br>
<br>
Review: 2.5. For the experience. It was the first (and probably last) time I ate hot pot. By food, 2. I don't think this is my style. The food doesn't hold up on its own very well.
<br>
<br>
Price: $35/person for dinner. If you buy extra stuff, entrees are $15-20 per person.
<br>
<br>
Parking: Easy. Park nearby for cheap. $5 or less. Garage parking.
<br>
<br>
Final Number: 2.
