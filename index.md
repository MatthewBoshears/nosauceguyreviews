Greetings. I'm No Sauce Guy. I prefer my food *without* sauce. I will have reviews from Sauce Guy 1 & 2 (names WIP) alongside my own.
<br>
Together, you should be able to get a reasonable opinion. I review things based on my personal opinions and tastes. I'm a vinegar-based barbeque enthusiast and lover of food, generally.
<br>
These are basically all going to be "I could go here once a week" kind of places. I like to eat out around once per week. I try to keep my costs to under $50-60, usually aiming for $20-30. Hard in Northern Virginia, but it's my style.
<br>
I use the following rating system:
<br>
1 -> I wouldn't recommend it even if it was free.
<br>
2 -> I would recommend if someone else was paying for most or all of it.
<br>
3 -> I would pay full price if I was nearby and hungry. I would not drive more than 20 minutes or so.
<br>
4 -> I would encourage you to make a trip to eat this. I would drive up to 45-60 minutes.
<br>
5 -> You should prioritize making a trip to go eat at this place. I would drive multiple hours.
<br>
